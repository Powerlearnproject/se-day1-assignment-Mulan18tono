# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.-
-software engineering is the process of writing codes(instructions) in computers that can solve a particular problem.
-Software engineering helps us to solve environmental problems.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-mastering the machine-is when you identify the machine and its availability and accessibility in editing and  compiling the program.
-mastering the process for developing the codes foor the future program.
-mastering in communication for managing and improving the final products.
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
-planning and reqirement analysis is where you gather requirements to create a basic project plan
-defining requirements is where the requirements are specified
-designing the product is where you choose the best product designed.
-developing the product is where the developers writes the code.
-testing is where you test and identify and fix any problems arose.
-deplying the product is where the final product is testedin real life.
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
-waterfall mothodologist is where each phase must be completed before the next begins like projects with well defined requirements while agile methodogists is where the phases are frequently allowed to changes like projects that need changeing reqirements
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
-Software developer is responsible for developing and writing the codes of the software while the Quality Assuarance engineer is responsible for creating and perform test and identify errors and giving feedbacks while project manager is responsible to manage the projects by planning,executing andclosing projects.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
-the IDEs are programs design to help devolpers design the applications example GUI and VCS is a software that helps the develping team to manage and communicate all changes made to the program example changing the codes.
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-customer demands- there should be applications online where the customer can ask further questions and learn how to use the product or program.
-security concerns-the security of the programs should be upgraded afteratleast when they upgrade the program.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
-unit testing checks if the functions are fully functionning well while integration testing is checking the data flow from the modules while system testing is where testing the entire system for errors and acceptance testing is testing the final system the requirements of the specification.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
-Prompt engineering is giving instructions,commands or questions to a machine that thinks like a human(robot) and it gives accurate answers.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
-Lack of specifications it can be improved by making clear instuctions to guide the AI on how to work and get clear answers.
